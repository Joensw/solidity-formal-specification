This repository contains the Solidity source files of my bachelor's thesis titled *Verifiably Correct Implementations of Basic
Data Structures in Solidity*.

Within the scope of my thesis, I created functionally verified implementations of Lists, Sets, Iterable Mappings and Caller Specific Mappings.Â 
For each of these data structures, there is a corresponding folder containing implementations with various primitive data types.

The Experimental folder contains partially verified implementations of some of the data structures with non primitive types.

The tools folder contains the timing and generation tools used.

Further explanations can be found in the [PDF](https://jonas-wille.github.io/assets/files/Thesis.pdf).
